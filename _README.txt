This theme uses SASS (scss). See the config.rb file for compass configuration etc.

There is a Gemfile included, use Bundler ("bundle install") to install the required gems (compass etc).

Then use "bundle exec compass watch" to poll for changes.

Image assets are always delcared relative to the /css/images directory, see config.rb.
